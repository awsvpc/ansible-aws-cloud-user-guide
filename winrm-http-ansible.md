  Below is the Dockerfile to support WinRM and authenticate to a remote server using AD credentials, along with the Ansible playbook and a bash script to generate the necessary inventory and configuration files:

Dockerfile:

Dockerfile

# Base image
FROM amazonlinux:2

# Install necessary packages
RUN yum install -y python3-pip && \
    yum clean all

# Install Ansible and dependencies
RUN pip3 install ansible pywinrm

# Copy files into the container
COPY ansible_playbook.yml /ansible/
COPY generate_inventory.sh /ansible/
COPY ansible.cfg /ansible/

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /ansible
Ansible Playbook (ansible_playbook.yml):

## code 
---
- name: Example Playbook
  hosts: windows_servers
  tasks:
    - name: Example WinRM Task
      win_command: hostname
      register: hostname_output
    
    - debug:
        var: hostname_output.stdout
Bash Script (generate_inventory.sh):

## Code: 
#!/bin/bash

# Generate inventory file
echo "[windows_servers]" > inventory.txt
echo "your_windows_server_ip" >> inventory.txt

# Generate Ansible configuration file
cat <<EOF > ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory = inventory.txt
interpreter_python = auto_silent
[privilege_escalation]
become = true
become_method = runas
become_user = your_domain_username
become_password = '{{ lookup("env", "MYADCREDCRED_ID") }}'
EOF
In the bash script above, replace "your_windows_server_ip" with the actual IP address of your Windows server. Also, replace "your_domain_username" with the domain username for authentication.

Ensure that the Jenkins credential ID for the AD credentials is "myadcred" as specified. The bash script uses an environment variable MYADCREDCRED_ID to fetch the password securely from Jenkins.

Remember to set appropriate permissions (chmod +x generate_inventory.sh) to make the script executable.

This Dockerfile sets up an Amazon Linux 2 environment with Ansible and its dependencies installed. It also copies the Ansible playbook (ansible_playbook.yml), the bash script for generating the inventory and configuration files (generate_inventory.sh), and the Ansible configuration file (ansible.cfg) into the container.
